**Understanding and analysing run time complexity  for above algorithms.**

* **Constant -- O(1)**

    * Processing time doesn't depend on input , it's constant.

* **Linear -- O(n)**

    * Processing time is proportional to input or collection , like iterating array once.

* **Logarithmic  -- O(logn)**

    * Processing time is slightly less relative to input collection.

      For example ; linear search is the basic search operation one can perform it's equal to collection length or slightly less than length.

* **Quadratic  -- O(n^2)**

   * Processing time is Quadratic. meaning every element in collection or input to be compared to every other element.

* **Quasi Linear  -- O(nlogn)**

   * Doubling input doesn't exactly double the iteration work , it's slightly less than comparing every element with other element.
     Sorting problems

* **Exponential -- O(2^n)**

   *If you add a single element to collection the processing power required doubles.
